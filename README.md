# Vigenere-decipher
Basic python script to crack a Vigenere cipher using Kasiski elimination

**Limitations**
Plaintext can't be a repeating sequence

Needs a sufficiently long plaintext for frequency analysis to work properly.

**Potential optimization**
Code for finding repeating sequences is not the prettiest. Probably could be done cleaner and more efficiently

The key length is not automatically calculated
